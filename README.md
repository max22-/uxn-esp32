# Uxn for the Wio Terminal

This is a port of the Varvara computer and the Uxn virtual machine by Devine Lu Linvega to the Wio Terminal by Seeed Studio.

The port was inspired by [Maxime's port to the ESP32](https://github.com/max22-/uxn-esp32), however, little code remains of that effort.

## Prerequisites

The port uses PlatformIO and Microsoft Visual Studio Code as IDE.

## Status

Work on the port has only just started. Neither of the screen (PPU), filesystem or a audio devices (APU) have been implemented.
However, as simple "Hello World" does work.
